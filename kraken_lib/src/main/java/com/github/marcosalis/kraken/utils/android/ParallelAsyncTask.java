/**
 * Extension of {@link AsyncTask} that forces parallel tasks execution in
 * Honeycomb and higher Android versions by calling
 * {@link #executeOnExecutor(Executor, Object[])} when using API <= 13.
 * 
 * In fact, as specified by AsyncTask documentation, starting from Honeycomb the
 * tasks execution is performed in a single-threaded executor:
 * 
 * <code>
 * <h2>Order of execution</h2>
 * <p>When first introduced, AsyncTasks were executed serially on a single background
 * thread. Starting with {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#DONUT}, this was changed
 * to a pool of threads allowing multiple tasks to operate in parallel. Starting with
 * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}, tasks are executed on a single
 * thread to avoid common application errors caused by parallel execution.</p>
 * <p>If you truly want parallel execution, you can invoke
 * {@link #executeOnExecutor(java.util.concurrent.Executor, Object[])} with
 * {@link #THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR}.</p>
 * </code>
 * 
 * The client must use the {@link #parallelExec(Object...)} instead of
 * {@link AsyncTask#execute(Object...)} otherwise an exception will be thrown.
 * 
 * @see AsyncTask
